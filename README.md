# Cosmos Cloud

The Cosmos Cloud is a smart-home system that is used to control the home (and beyond) through the use of modularized components connected to a central hub. Modules come in both a software and hardware form, interacting completely with the central server. This allows modules to interact with all other modules - giving complete control to the user to tailor to specific use cases, whether it be for accessibility, luxury, or other uses.

Installation:

Cosmos Cloud requires node v6.9.0 and higher and NPM 3.0 and higher.

Requires [CosmosCould-Node-SD](https://github.com/alex-osman/CosmosCloud-Nodes-SD) to communicate with.

Install the dependencies start the server.

  ```sh
  $ cd CosmosCloud_SD
  $ npm install 
  $ brew install mongodb
  $ npm run build
  ```
